SELogger is a tool to record an execution trace of a Java program.
The tool name "SE" means Software Engineering, because the tool is developed for software engineering research topics including omniscient debugging. 


## Build

Build a jar file with Maven.

        mvn package

SELogger uses ASM (http://asm.ow2.org/) for injecting logging code.
The class names are shaded by maven-shade-plugin so that 
SELogger can manipulate a program using ASM. 

### How to Build for JDK7

selogger works with JDK 7 while selogger's test cases requires JDK 8 to test the behavior of INVOKEDYNAMIC instructions.
If you would like to build a jar file for JDK7, please skip compilation of test classes as follows.
  - Prepare JDK 7 and Maven.
  - Replace the JDK version `1.8` with `1.7` for the `maven-compiler-plugin` in `pom.xml`.
  - Execute `mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true`.

## Usage

Execute your program with the Java Agent.

        java -javaagent:path/to/selogger-0.2.3.jar [Application Options]

The agent accepts options.  Each option is specified by `option=value` style with commas (","). For example:

        java -javaagent:path/to/selogger-0.2.3.jar=output=dirname,format=freq [Application Options]


### Output Options

The `output=` option specifies a directory to store an execution trace.  
The directory is automatically created if it does not exist.
The default output directory is `selogger-output`.

The `format=` option specifies an output format.  The default is `latest` format.
  * `freq` mode records only a frequency table of events.
  * `latest` mode records the latest event data with timestamp and thread ID for each bytecode location. 
  * `nearomni` mode is an alias of `latest`.
  * `latest-simple` mode records only the latest event data for each bytecode location.
  * `omni` mode records all the events in a stream.
  * `discard` mode discard event data, while it injects logging code into classes.

In `latest` and `latesttime` mode, two additional options are available:
  * `size=` specifies the size of buffers.  The default is 32.
  * `keepobj=false` keeps objects using weak references to avoid the impact of GC.  It reduces memory consumption, while some object information may be lost.


### Logging Target Options

The `weave=` option specifies events to be recorded. Supported event groups are: 

  * EXEC (entry/exit)
  * CALL (call)
  * PARAM (parameters for method entries and calls)
  * FIELD (field access)
  * ARRAY (array creation and access)
  * OBJECT (constant object usage)
  * SYNC (synchronized blocks)
  * LOCAL (local variables)
  * LABEL (conditional branches)

The default configuration records all events. 

The selogger inserts logging code into all the classes except for system classes: `sun/`,`com/sun/`, `java/`, and `javax/`.
You can add a prefix of class names whose behavior is excluded from the logging process using `e=` option.  Use multiple `e=` options to enumerate class paths.

Note: The event category names EXEC and CALL come from AspectJ pointcut: execution and call.



### Option for Troubleshooting

The `dump=true` option stores class files including logging code into the output directory. It may help a debugging task if invalid bytecode is generated. 


## Package Structure

SELogger comprises three sub-packages: `logging`, `reader`, and `weaver`.

  - The `weaver` sub-package is an implementation of Java Agent.  
    - RuntimeWeaver class is the entry point of the agent.  It calls ClassTransformer to inject logging instructions into target classes.
  - The `logging` sub-package implements logging features.
    - Logging class is the entry point of the logging feature.  It records runtime events in files.
  - The `reader` sub-package implements classes to read log files.
    - LogPrinter class is an example to read `.slg` files generated by logging classes. 


## Runtime Events

The runtime events are listed in `selogger.EventType` class. 
Each event is recorded before/after a particular bytecode instruction is executed.
Hence, SELogger assigns `data ID` to each event based on the bytecode location (class, method, and instruction position in the method).
Using the data ID, users can distinguish events generated by different bytecode instructions.

Each runtime event has static attributes, e.g. method name called by a method call instruction.
Those attributes are stored in `dataids.txt` in the output directory.

The dynamic information, data recorded with events are stored in a trace file.
The default `nearomni` option generates a text file named `recentdata.txt` whose line includes the following data items in a CSV format:
 - Data ID representing an event
 - The number of the events observed in the execution 
 - The number of events recorded in the file
 - A list of recorded values (triples of a data value, a sequential number representing the order of recording, and a thread ID) for the events

The following table is a list of events.
The event name is defined in the class `EventType`.

### Runtime Data Contents in the Omniscient mode

#### LOG$Types.txt

The file records object types.
It is a CSV file including 6 columns.

- Type ID
- Type Name
- Class file location
- The superclass type ID
- The component type ID (available for an array type) 
- A string representation of class loader that loaded the type and followed by the class name.  This text is linked to the weaving information (`classes.txt`) described below.

#### LOG$ObjectTypesNNNNN.txt

This CSV file includes two columns.
Each row represents an object.

- The first column shows the object ID.
- The second column shows the type ID.

#### LOG$ExceptionNNNNN.txt

This is a semi-structured CSV file records messages and stack traces of exceptions thrown during a program execution.
Each exception is recorded by the following lines.

- Message line including three columns
  - Object ID of the Throwable object
  - A literal "M"
  - Textual message returned by `Throwable.getMessage()`
- Cause Object
  - Object ID of the Throwable object
  - A literal "CS"
  - Object ID of the cause object returned by `Throwable.getCause()`
  - If the object has suppressed exceptions (returned by `getSuppressed()`), their object IDs
- Stack Trace Elements (Each line corresponds to a single line of a stack trace)
  - Object ID of the Throwable object
  - A literal "S"
  - A literal "T" or "F": "T" represents the method is a native method.
  - Class Name
  - Method Name
  - File Name
  - Line Number

#### LOG$StringNNNNN.txt

The file records the contents of string objects used in an execution.
It is a CSV file format; each line has three fields.

- The object ID of the string
- The length of the string
- The content escaped as a JSON string

## Weaving Events

The weaver component generates the following files during the weaving. 
 - `weaving.properties`: The configuration options recognized by the weaver.
 - `classes.txt`: A list of woven classes.  The content is defined in the `selogger.weaver.ClassInfo` class.
 - `methods .txt`: A list of methods in the woven classes.  The content is defined in the `selogger.weaver.MethodInfo` class.
 - `dataids.txt`: A list of Data IDs. 
 - `log.txt`: Recording errors encountered during bytecode manipulation.
 
 
## Limitation

The logging feature for some instructions (in particular, JUMP, RET, INVOKEDYNAMIC instructions) has not been tested well due to the lack of appropriate test cases.

To record Local variable names and line numbers, the tool uses debugging information embedded in class files. 

## Differences from master branch version

The execution trace recorded in this version is incompatible with the master branch version.
The major differences are:
 * Simplified data format
 * Simplified instrumentation implementation
 * Simplified logging implementation (easy to extend)
 * Supported load-time weaving
 * Supported tracing jumps caused by exceptions
 * Supported fixed-size buffer logging
 * Improved reliability with JUnit test cases

The documentation for the master branch is available in the `doc` directory.
